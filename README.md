# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
ðŸ§  Why I Built This

While preparing for my own job hunt, I realized how quickly things can get chaotic â€” tracking applications, remembering statuses, and following up. I wanted to create a tool that simplifies this process, not just for me, but for others going through the same.

This project was also a way for me to level up in React, test my research skills, and dive into tools I hadnâ€™t used before like Firebase, Tailwind CSS, and Chart.js â€” each of which taught me something valuable.

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

- React â€“ Frontend framework  
- Firebase â€“ Backend services (auth & data storage)  
- Tailwind CSS â€“ Utility-first styling  
- Chart.js â€“ Data visualization  
- React Router â€“ Navigation and routing

ðŸš€ Features

- Add and edit job applications (company, position, status, etc.)  
- Track application status (Applied, Interview, Offer, Rejected)  
- Visual dashboard with interactive charts  
- Dark mode support  
- Firebase authentication and secure data storage  
- Clean, responsive design for desktopÂ andÂ mobile

 
 ðŸ“Š What I Learned
- How to structure a full-scale React app  
- Integration of third-party tools like Firebase and Chart.js  
- Responsive UI design using Tailwind  
- Real-world debugging, state management, and authentication flow  
- Importance of building something people actually need

ðŸ›  Still in Progress

I'm continuously improving this app â€” polishing features, adding filters, improving UX, and learning from user feedback.

ðŸŽ¯ Future Additions

- Notifications/reminders for application follow-ups  
- Resume and cover letter upload  
- Multi-user support with personalized dashboards  
- Integration with job listing APIs
